The Passenger Count App is a web-application designed to help users keep track of the number of passengers boarding and alighting at each stop or location.
The passenger count is updated in real-time, providing instant feedback to users.
I have used basic HTML ,CSS and JAVASCRIPT to ensure a smooth user experience.
